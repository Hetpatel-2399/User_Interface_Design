## Description

This is a project based on developing a user interface design for chess game, user can play with AI (Artifical Intelligence Alogirthm for chess game ) as well as two player.


## About

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkerboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 square grid. ... Each player begins with 16 pieces:
one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
In, our Game you will find out this kind of layout, where row 8 & 7 are of black side, and row 1 & 2 are of white side.

TYPES OF MOVES USED IN PROJECT
- Pawn Promotion
- SPECIAL MOVES
- CASTLING MOVE
- EnPassant

##Alogrithm

- The Computer option will have AI setting, since we are using the ALPHA-BETA ALGORITHM, it is use for the movement of the chess pieces. 
- Secondly, using null-move pruning it is a technique used to enhance the speed of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
- Third, Principal variation (PV) node is the one where One or more of the moves will return a score greater than alpha (a PV move), but none will return a score greater than or equal to beta.
- Quiescence search which is an algorithm typically used to extend search at unstable nodes in minimax game trees in game-playing computer programs.
- Show computer think depth, in which user can see the speed of determining whether a computer is capable of thinking like a human being or not.
